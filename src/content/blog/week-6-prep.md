 **Topic: Classification Algorithms**
## High-Level Overview
1. Naive Bayes
	- A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem
	- Assumes features are independent (naive)
	- Works well for text classification (i.e. spam detection, sentiment analysis)
	- Fast and efficient, even with larger datasets
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
	- A non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm
	- Classifies a data point based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors
	- No training phase, all computation happens at prediction time
	- Very simple but computationally expensive for larger datasets
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
	- Finds the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes
	- Can handle non-linear data using the kernel trick
	- Works well for high-dimensional spaces
	- Computationally expensive for larger datasets
4. Random Forest
	- An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees
	- Reduces overfitting compared to a single decision tree
	- Works well with both categorical and numeric data
	- Less interpretable compared to individual decision trees
## Deeper Explanation of Naive Bayes
### Bayes Theorem
Naive Bayes is based on Bayes' Theorem, which states:
$$
P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)\times P(A)}{P(B)}
$$
Where:
- $P(A|B)$ is the posterior probability (i.e. probability of class $A$ given feature $B$)
- $P(B|A)$ is the likelihood (i.e. probability of feature $B$ given class $A$)
- $P(A)$ is the prior probability (i.e. probability of class $A$ occurring)
- $P(B)$ is the evidence (i.e. probability of feature $B$ occurring)
### Classification Using Naive Bayes
For a given input with multiple features $X=(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$, the probability of it belonging to class $C_k$ is:
$$
P(C_k|X)=\frac{P(X|C_k)\times P(C_k)}{P(X)}
$$
Using the naive assumption that features are conditionally independent, the likelihood simplifies to:
$$
P(X|C_k)=P(x_1|C_k)P(x_2|C_k)...P(x_n|C_k)
$$
To classify, we choose the class $C_k$ that maximizes:
$$
P(C_k)\prod_{i=1}^{n}P(x_i|C_k)
$$

| Algorithm | Pros | Cons | Best Use Cases |
|-----------|------|------|---------------|
| **Naive Bayes** | Fast, works well with high-dimensional data, handles missing values | Assumes independence of features, not good for complex decision boundaries | Text classification, spam filtering |
| **KNN** | Simple, no training phase, works well with non-linear data | Slow for large datasets, memory-intensive, sensitive to irrelevant features | Small datasets, recommendation systems |
| **SVM** | Handles high-dimensional data well, effective for complex classification tasks | Computationally expensive, hard to interpret | Image classification, bioinformatics |
| **Random Forest** | Reduces overfitting, handles mixed data types, robust | Less interpretable, slower training | General-purpose classification, fraud detection |
