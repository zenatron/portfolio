(Optional)Â If you wish to include this response as a blog post on your own portfolio website instead, you may do so! Just create your blog post and then paste your link to it here for others to view.

Using provided resources and/or those you find on your own, discuss:

1. What is data mining? What are some examples of how data mining can be used?
2. What are the different steps of the pipeline? Briefly discuss each.
3. Why is defining the problem first so important?
4. Why is data cleaning/pre-processing important? What are some aspects of data that need to be cleaned (for example, dealing with null values)?
5. Find an example of some data understanding/visualizations (e.g., blog post, portfolio). What do you like and/or dislike about it?

It's encouraged to also read and respond to each other. All the preparation discussions will contribute to your overall participation.
