## Interactive Staging with git add -p
Interactive staging allows you to review and stage changes hunk by hunk, giving you granular control over what gets committed.

| Key | Action                                    | Description                                                 |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| y   | Stage this hunk                           | Accept and stage the current hunk                           |
| n   | Do not stage this hunk                    | Skip the current hunk                                       |
| q   | Quit                                      | Stop reviewing; no further hunks will be staged             |
| a   | Stage this hunk and all remaining hunks   | Accept this and every remaining hunk in the file            |
| d   | Do not stage this hunk or any later hunks | Reject the current hunk and all remaining hunks in the file |
| s   | Split the current hunk                    | Break the hunk into smaller parts for more precise staging  |
| e   | Manually edit the current hunk            | Open the hunk in your editor for custom modifications       |
| ?   | Help                                      | Display a summary of these options                          |

Usage:
```bash
git add -p
```

When prompted, type the corresponding key (y, n, s, etc.) to decide how to handle each hunk.

## Branching and Merging
| Command      | Description                                    | Options/Flags                                | Example                                                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| git branch   | List, create, or delete branches               | -d: delete a branch                          | `git branch new-feature ` or `git branch -d old-feature` |
| git checkout | Switch branches or restore working files       | N/A (being gradually replaced by git switch) | `git checkout new-feature`                                    |
| git switch   | A modern, user-friendly way to change branches | -c: create and switch to a new branch        | `git switch new-feature ` or `git switch -c new-feature` |
| git merge    | Combine changes from different branches        | N/A                                          | `git checkout main` or `git merge feature/login`         |

Real-World Merge Example:
1. You have a feature branch "feature/login" and want to merge it into "main":
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/login
```
1. If conflicts occur, Git will mark the affected files. Open and manually resolve these conflicts, then:
```bash
git add conflicted-file
git commit
```

---
## Rebasing and Resetting

### Git Rebase
Rebasing re-applies commits on top of another base commit to produce a linear history.
Basic Example:
```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```
Interactive Rebase (for cleaning up commit history):
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~5
```
Handling Conflicts During Rebase:
1. Git stops at the conflicting commit.
2. Manually resolve conflicts in the affected files.
3. Stage the resolved files:
```bash
git add <conflicted-file>
```
1. Continue the rebase:
```bash
git rebase --continue
```

### Real-World Examples for git reset
#### 1. git reset --soft  
**Scenario:** You committed too soon and want to add more changes before pushing.  
**Example:** 
1. You are working on a new feature and accidentally commit too early:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Started new feature"
```
1. You realize you forgot to include some important files.
2. Use `git reset --soft` to undo the commit but **keep the changes staged**:
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```
1. Now, add the missing files:
```bash
git add additional-file.js
```
1. Re-commit everything together:
```bash
git commit -m "Completed new feature with additional files"
```
1. The history is clean, and you can now push the correct commit.  
**Best Use Case:** When you need to **edit the last commit** before pushing but want to keep everything staged.

#### 2. git reset --mixed  
**Scenario:** You committed the wrong files and want to unstage them before committing again.  
**Example:**  
1. You mistakenly commit files that shouldn’t be included:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added feature (oops, included config.json)"
```
1. You want to remove `config.json` from the commit before pushing.
2. Use `git reset --mixed` (or simply `git reset` as mixed is the default) to **undo the commit and unstage all changes**:
```bash
git reset HEAD~1
```
1. Now, remove the unwanted file from staging:
```bash
git restore --staged config.json
```
1. Re-commit only the correct files:
```bash
git commit -m "Added feature (without config.json)"
```
1. Your commit now contains only what should be in the repository.  
 **Best Use Case:** When you need to **redo a commit** while keeping your work but removing unwanted files.

#### 3. git reset --hard  
**Scenario:** You made a mess of your working directory and want to start over.  
**Example:**  
1. You experimented with changes that broke your project:
```bash
echo "Some bad code" >> app.js
git add .
git commit -m "Added buggy code"
```
1. Then, you made even more destructive edits.
2. Instead of manually fixing everything, reset to the last known good commit:
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
1. Your project is now **exactly as it was before the last commit**—all bad changes are **permanently erased**.  
**Warning:** This action is **irreversible** unless you have a backup or know the commit hash.  
**Best Use Case:** When you want to **completely remove changes and reset your project to a known good state**.
#### Summary Table for git reset Modes
| Reset Mode   | What it Does                                   | Use Case                                                  |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| --soft      | Moves HEAD but **keeps changes staged**        | Editing the last commit before pushing                  |
| --mixed     | Moves HEAD and **unstages changes**, but keeps them in the working directory | Redo a commit while preserving your work (remove unwanted files) |
| --hard      | Moves HEAD and **discards all changes**        | Start fresh and completely remove mistakes              |

## Undoing Changes
| Command         | Description                                                          | Example                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| git revert      | Create a new commit that undoes changes from a previous commit       | `git revert <commit-hash>` |
| git cherry-pick | Apply changes introduced by an existing commit to the current branch | `git cherry-pick abc1234`  |

Example:
```bash
git revert a1b2c3d4
git cherry-pick e5f6g7h8
```

---
## Working with Remote Repositories
| Command    | Description                                        | Options/Flags           | Example                                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| git remote | Manage remote repository URLs                      | add, remove, rename     | `git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git` |
| git fetch  | Download objects and refs from a remote repository | N/A                     | `git fetch origin`                                       |
| git pull   | Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository   | N/A                     | `git pull origin main`                                   |
| git push   | Update remote refs along with associated objects   | -u: set upstream branch | `git push -u origin main`                                |

Example:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
git fetch origin
git pull origin main
git push -u origin main
```

---
## Handling Merge Conflicts
Merge conflicts occur when changes from different branches affect the same part of a file. Here’s how to resolve them:

**Merge Conflict Resolution Example:**
1. Start merging a feature branch into main:
       git checkout main
       git merge feature-branch
2. If conflicts occur, Git marks the affected files with conflict markers (e.g., `<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>`).
3. Open each conflicted file and manually resolve the differences.
4. Stage the resolved files:
```bash
git add <conflicted-file>
```
1. Finalize the merge with:
```bash
git commit
```

**During a Rebase:**
After manually resolving conflicts:
```bash
git add <conflicted-file>
git rebase --continue
```

## Advanced Git Techniques
### Stashing Changes 
Stashing lets you temporarily save changes that aren’t ready to commit. 

| Command         | Description                                                              | Example                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| git stash       | Save your current modifications and revert the working directory to HEAD | `git stash save "WIP: working on login feature"` |
| git stash list  | List all stashed changes                                                 | `git stash list`                                 |
| git stash apply | Reapply stashed changes without removing them from the stash list        | `git stash apply stash@{0}`                      |
| git stash drop  | Remove a specific stash entry                                            | `git stash drop stash@{0}`                       |
### Tagging 

| Command         | Description                            | Example                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| git tag         | List or create tags                    | `git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0 Release"` |
| git push --tags | Push all tags to the remote repository | `git push origin --tags`                   |

## Additional Topics
### Git Workflows
Choose a workflow that fits your project’s needs.
- **Git Flow:** A branching model with dedicated branches for features, development, releases, and hotfixes.
      Example:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature develop
git flow release start 1.0.0
```
- **GitHub Flow:** A lightweight workflow using feature branches and pull requests.
      Example:
```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
(make changes)
git push -u origin new-feature
Then create a pull request on GitHub
```
### Git Hooks
Git hooks are scripts that run automatically at specific points in the Git workflow.
Example:
```bash
# Edit the pre-commit hook at .git/hooks/pre-commit and add:
#!/bin/sh
npm test
```
Ensure the hook script is executable.
### Git Submodules
Submodules let you include and manage external repositories within your main repository.
Example:
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/user/submodule-repo.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
### Advanced Configuration and Aliases
Customize Git with aliases and configuration tweaks.
Examples:
```bash
git config --global alias.st status
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.br branch
```
Set up a global ignore file:
```bash
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

## Tips & Best Practices
- Commit frequently and write clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Use branches for features and bug fixes; merge or rebase regularly to maintain a clean history.
- Leverage interactive staging (git add -p) to review changes before committing.
- Regularly push to remote repositories to back up your work and facilitate collaboration.
- Review Git logs and diffs to catch potential errors early.
- Customize Git aliases to streamline your workflow.
